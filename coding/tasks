how would one organize something like this, 
jira trello monday sheets other?
whatever going to make a list 

move off of the baseline godaddy hosting site 
  create static page and point dns to github pages? 


set up auth for google cloud with github actions 
  document patterns so I can do this in both personal account and business account
